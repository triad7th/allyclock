# AllyClock Push Code

Push committed AllyClock changes deliberately, without hiding local state or pushing the wrong branch.

## Workflow

1. Inspect repository state:
   - `git status --short --branch`
   - `git remote -v`
   - `git log --oneline --decorate -5`
2. Confirm the branch and upstream:
   - Prefer the current branch.
   - Use `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref --symbolic-full-name @{u}` to check upstream.
   - If no upstream exists, use `git push -u origin <current-branch>` when `origin` exists.
   - If multiple remotes exist and intent is unclear, ask before pushing.
3. Check what will be pushed:
   - If upstream exists, run `git log --oneline @{u}..HEAD`.
   - If upstream exists, run `git diff --stat @{u}..HEAD`.
   - If there are no commits ahead, do not push; report that the branch is already up to date.
4. Protect local work:
   - Do not push when there are uncommitted source changes unless the user explicitly asked to push anyway.
   - Untracked docs or local notes may be allowed only when clearly unrelated to the commits being pushed.
   - Never use force push unless the user explicitly asks for it.
   - Never rewrite history, rebase, amend, or reset as part of pushing unless explicitly requested.
5. Run final validation when appropriate:
   - If commits since upstream include Web changes, prefer `npm run build` or the closest relevant check.
   - If commits since upstream include iOS changes, prefer the app's configured iOS check when available.
   - If commits are docs-only or repo workflow-only, validation may be skipped.
   - If validation was already run during the same session after the last commit, reuse that result.
   - If validation fails, stop before pushing unless the user explicitly asks to push failing work.
6. Push:
   - Existing upstream: `git push`
   - No upstream: `git push -u origin <current-branch>`
   - After pushing, run `git status --short --branch`.

## Branch Guidance

- Do not push directly to `main` if the user asked for a feature branch or PR workflow.
- If already on `main` and commits are present, pushing to `main` is acceptable only when that matches the repo's current workflow or the user's request.
- If the user asks for a PR, push the branch first, then use the repo's GitHub workflow or GitHub tooling to open the PR.

## Final Response

Report:

- Remote and branch pushed.
- Commit hashes and subjects pushed.
- Validation command and result, or why validation was skipped.
- Final branch status.
